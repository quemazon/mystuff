=AVC 2012 - Minuteman To Do List=
----

==Coding==
----
  # How do I correctly put in waypoints when the car servos are in full autonomous mode (i.e. ESC may also be controlled)? Car seems to jump around when I push the waypoint program button.
  # Create routine to write array into EEPROM at the start of the sketch
  # Create routine to check if radio is in specific setting at start of sketch. Make that setting determine if the pre-determined waypoints will be written into EEPROM or if the arduino will use the existing waypoints.
  # Make LED on pin 13 light up when waypoint is accepted as a visual indicator that the button may be released
  # Add menus to the LCD to enable easier programming of the car
  # Create header file that allows easier sharing of code. The header file should include:
    * any other items that may differ from one car to another
    * ~~routine for initially printing out the "Minuteman!" / "***ROADRUNNER*** Beep! Beep!" statement~~
    * ~~gyro calibration factor~~
    * ~~tire calibration factor~~
    * ~~calibration/adjustment factor to drive in a straight line~~
  # ~~User inputted waypoints from excel do NOT need to be written into EEPROM~~
  # ~~Switch the null print out of the LCD from "####null" to "Null: ####"~~
  # ~~Increase waypoint accept time from .5-1.5 seconds to .5-2.5 seconds~~
  # ~~Clean up the code by deleting all the old comments, LCD printouts, unused functions, unused variables, etc~~


==Steering Calibration Branch==
----
Create branch to perform steering calibration:
  # program in a heading that is fixed
  # set the car in autonomous mode (speed is controlled)
  # press the throttle and monitor the angle. If the “x” value changes, then adjust the steering calibration number accordingly until it is straight 
  # with time permitting, have the controller sweep through a range of steering values and have it hunt for the best setting where the angle changes least



==Excel Spreadsheet==
----
  # Plot exported waypoints from car
  # Plot new waypoints for car
  # Add diagram showing location of barrels
  # Add diagram showing accurate perimeter of Sparkfun building
  # Add export function that formats a string that may easily be read into by arduino, that string does NOT need to be written into EEPROM
  # Excel sheet should take into account the tire size calibration factor or put that in the header file


==Hardware==
----
  # Calibrate gyro for different temperature ranges
  # Create calibration factor for those temperature ranges
  # Calibrate steering so that the car drives straight. (see steering calibration branch above.) ~~Add that calibration factor into the header file.~~
